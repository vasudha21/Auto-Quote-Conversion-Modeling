# Auto-Quote-Conversion-Modeling
Project Description

You work for Peace of Mind Insurance Company in their personal automotive insurance department as a modeler. For personal auto, anyone that asks for an estimated price for a policy from your company (also known as a quote) will receive one. However, of those quoted, only a fraction will choose your company as their insurer (versus other companies they also received quotes from). Your team has been asked to build what’s known as a conversion model, with the goal of understanding the population of policies Peace of Mind Insurance Company is most likely to write (a.k.a. issue or convert). In other words, what types of customers is your company writing over its competitors?

Your goals in this competition are as follows:

    Identify quoted policies that your company will convert (a.k.a. issue)
    
    Understand key characteristics of policies your company tends to write, as well as those they tend not to write (e.g. understand quoted policies with both high and low conversion rates)
    
    Provide a recommendation on how this information could be leveraged at Peace of Mind Insurance
    
    While there are no constraints on the type of model you build, the colleagues that have asked your team to get this information are not modelers and have no 
    statistical background. 
    
    It’ll be important to remember this when explaining your findings and recommendations.
